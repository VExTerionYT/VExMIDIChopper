If you want to use this tool in Thonny, you need to install the Python libraries mido and pygame.

Steps:

Open Thonny.

Go to Tools → Manage packages…

Search for mido and click Install.

Search for pygame and click Install.

Now you can open and run the script directly in Thonny.

Note: On some systems, you may need to run Thonny as administrator to install packages properly.
